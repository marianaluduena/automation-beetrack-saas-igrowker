# automation-beetrack-saas-igrowker

Here is **all the documentation generated, and will be added all my automated tests** with **Playwright** from the **Beetrack** project builded during my 2nd IT training programm in **Igrowker**

## Summary: üìö

This time, I took on the role of **QA Lead for my team**, drawing on my experience from the previous training to provide guidance  I encouraged my fellow QAs to **share their ideas and opinions, and we made decisions collaboratively.**

The **relationship** with the whole team (Devs, PM, UX, etc) **was so good that we all decided we want to continue improving Beetrack, even when this training is over!**
